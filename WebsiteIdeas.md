## Ideas for new website:
1. Moveable Tiles with small apps inside (weather app and so on), like a BirdDogHR landing page.
1. About me page with links to Socal media, resume download and preview,  References?
1. Custom CSS page with code
1. Possible games (snake, 2048, 2D games, possible 3D game with Engines)
1. private and public chatrooms with email notifications
1. link to github
